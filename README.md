# Android-Material-SearchView

**Example of a custom search animation**

The code is a little messy, not using it any of my applications as of now.  When I add it to Fit Health, I will upload a clean version with tests and check for errors. 

It also includes an example of TabLayout from the latest Design Library released by Google. 

**Two main files containing the search implementaion.**
- [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/EugeneHoran/Android-Material-SearchView/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/eugene/fithealth/Activities/MainActivity.java) 
- [InitiateSearch.java](https://github.com/EugeneHoran/Android-Material-SearchView/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/eugene/fithealth/Utilities/InitiateSearch.java) 

It also includes an APK if you would like to download it and test it out.
