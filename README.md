# Android-Material-SearchView

**Example of a custom search animation**

The code is a little messy, not using it any of my applications as of now.  When I add it to Fit Health, I will upload a clean version with tests and check for errors. 

It also includes an example of TabLayout from the latest Design Library released by Google. 

It also includes an APK if you would like to download it and test it out.
